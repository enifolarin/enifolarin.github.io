            <h4> BODIES ARE BODIES </h4>

            <p> One beautiful thing about people being born differently is being born uniquely. Everybody has their special features, and no one person is the same. Neither is anyone entitled to fall within a specific 'frame' of thought. </p>

            <p> Hold on, I just reminded myself I’m not writing an essay! Okay, let’s restart, yeah? </p>

            <p> Have you ever looked at a person and you felt like, 'oh, her body is awkward' or 'why does she look that way'? Oh, you haven't? Cause I have. I'll be 100 percent honest with you, it's completely human to think or feel like that. We think of people in a particular way, and once a person is a little bit strange to that perception, we feel something should be corrected.  But the truth is people can't be the way you perceive them to be. Lmao, why should people be the way you think they should be? After reading that out loud again, it sounds completely insane, lol. To think that some people sit and analyze people's bodies like 'okay, I think God made a mistake here. Her eyes should have been a little bigger. This side of fat is completely unnecessary, it shouldn't be there. And um, just a little fix of her legs should do. Yes, perfect body. But this? This is not a perfect body, I should tell her'. Sounds like a psychopath, yeah? Honestly, it just made me laugh out loud (like lol). </p>

            <p> What is your definition of a perfect body? Is there a perfect body? There are people of different sizes and shapes, how do we then know what a perfect body is?  </p>

            <p> To think that there's a perfect body everyone should work towards is a complete fantasy and a faulted limited  orientation. Some say 'let's be realistic, she needs to lose weight',  of course, if she wants. It's okay to want to be fit, to see a Kim Kardashian and want your body like that, that's completely all right. But no one should dictate to you what your 'perfect body' should look like. </p>

            <p> There's enough space in the world for people of different body shapes, height, skin color, and appearance. I mean if everyone looked the same, wouldn't be so boring? And do you know there are different fashion styles for different body types? When the world has been made so easy, why do you want to complicate things? We surely will come across extremely unique body types but instead of 'why does she look like that?' Or 'why is he not normal', say 'wow, she's so unique' or seal your mouth, lol. </p>

            <p> It's important that we love who we are and also embrace the uniqueness of others. And this goes for both males and females. So, rock that body of yours and do not stop. </p>
