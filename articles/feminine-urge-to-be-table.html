            <p> <b>Ladies and gentlemen,</b> </p>

            <p> The world has gone on a long ride and has shot us civilization and revolution. We barely can catch our breath sandwiched between the fat thighs of the different happenings. Now we watch ourselves succumb to change, even in worse and good ways. But never would I have thought that in addition to the number-not-specific genders that we currently have, there’d be one more and the most unbelievable at that. </p>

            <p> Kindly let me reintroduce you, ladies, gentlemen and tables, to the current world we live in. I know it’s not novel to anyone, especially when you’re living in the part of the world where everyone is hot (not dripping sexy hot, I mean quick-to-give-whoever-wishes-to-collect hot). However,  even with the knowledge that in the next 5 minutes some categories of people that want to be identified as a piece of furniture will be throwing rotten eggs at my face (they say it’s good facial treatment though; source: believe me or not), I’ll go ahead with telling you my unsolicited opinion. </p>

            <p> We’ve heard them talk about ‘male privilege’ all year, no, all decade, and that’s especially from someone sitting on comfy cushions behind her parent’s large TV ordering bottle water online. Trust me, I’d switch sides if I could. But my issue is, why do you have a rod chasing men on social media and you’re still telling them you want to be nothing but the four-legged piece of furniture they probably have to even manage from time to time?  </p>

            <p> How hard is picking a side? I mean we love Wonder woman and I for one have nothing against the psyduck in pokemon detective. But I’d bet my net worth no one will pay to watch a self acclaimed super woman that has no other super power but an explosive head (I take back my net worth, because someone’s about to dare me to make such a movie) But literally that is like the volcano pretending it always has things under control, and excuse me sir, you can’t even control your own head. </p>

            <p> Okay, let’s look at things from your perspective. All lives matter and we respect your gender preference. But I have to contest your choice of objects though? Why table? And what does being the table even mean? </p>

            <p> Seriously, I hold nothing against you for real. But sometimes, you've got to really bring something to the table, and stop trying to make yourself a piece of furniture. Or better still, pick a better one, like sofa bed or book case; a dresser even has quite the prestige.  </p>

            <p> It's disgusting to want equality and when you're asked for accountability, you turn yourself to a table. If it was a different time and age, we'd have probably handed you a trophy; best table of the year. But not now please, humans have caused enough ruckus. Behave yourself, there's a war going on. </p>
