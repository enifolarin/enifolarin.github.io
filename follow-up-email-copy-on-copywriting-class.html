            <h4> Subject line: The court case of Carlill v Carbolic is as a result of a copywriting error. </h4>

            <p> Hi (first name), </p>

            <p> Have you heard of the famous Carlill v Carbolic case. If you’re a stude, then you probably know this case like the back of your hands. </p>

            <p> If you’re not, I will give you a summary of what it is about. </p>

            <p> The defendant, the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company (imagine a company that provides cure for catarrh. Not exactly though, but that should give a clearer picture), placed an advertisement in a newspaper for their products, stating that any person who purchased and used their product but still contracted influenza (a flu) despite properly following the instructions would be entitled to a £100 reward. </p>

            <p> The advert further stated that the company had demonstrated its sincerity by placing £1000 in a bank account to act as the reward. </p>

            <p> This is where the problem ensued; the company argued that they could not be bound by the advert and that it was a mere ‘puff’ </p>

            <p> Now, let’s go back to the sole purpose of this letter. </p>

            <p> The Advert was a really clever one. It fulfilled most, if not all of the basics of a good ad structure. </p>

            <p> The ad makes the price visible enough that whoever reads it notices it quickly and is caught by it, ‘£100 REWARD’, very clever </p>

            <p> Anyone who sees that will immediately say, ‘okay what’s this about?’ And that’s how you start to get a customer’s attention. </p>

            <p> The ad makes the Bold promise believable by adding that the reward is already deposited in the bank, so they didn’t have to worry about not being rewarded. </p>


            <p> This automatically makes the customer think, ‘these people must be so sure of their product, it must be a good one. </p>
            <p> And if it doesn’t work, I can claim my reward. There’s nothing to lose’. </p>

            <p> And that’s just what you need to make anybody in the world feel in order for them to take the action you need them to. ‘Nothing to lose’. </p>

            <p> Also, notice that the ad highlights the benefits of the product, which is just perfect. </p>

            <p> This ad will immediately make a shitload of sales and it did make a shitload of sale. </p>
            <p> Where then is the error? </p>
            <p> An important thing in using Bold promises is being able to fulfill them. </p>
            <p> The ad failed the moment a customer used the Smoke ball and still caught influenza, and it failed even more when they were not able to give out the reward. </p>

            <p> Moral lesson? You must know where this is coming to by now. Bold promise is a very effective copywriting angle, in fact, one of the best as long as you can make it believable. </p>

            <p> But make sure your promise is one that you or your product can fulfill. </p>

            <p> You don’t want to spend years on a court case just because you wanted to sound cool. </p>
            <p> By the way, my copywriting master class will be ending soon, specifically on May 30th. John Ferdinand says, ‘it’s a game changer for copywriters in the present age.’ </p>
