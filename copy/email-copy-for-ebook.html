            <h4> Subject line: Do not set alarm clocks! </h4>
            <p> Almost everyone will tell you that setting alarm clocks and having a schedule will solve your
                procrastination problems. While they are not totally wrong, you know how much you snooze your alarm
                clocks and shift your tasks down the calendar. </p>

            <p> It’s okay, I do it too. In fact, almost everyone does it. However, it just may not be the long-term
                solution for someone who procrastinates. </p>

            <p> Take Binta for example. She was my college friend, and she never studied or did her assignments in time,
                but always spent most of her time gaming. When Binta noticed exam dates drew near, she set her alarm
                clock everyday to read and put studying in her list of tasks. </p>

            <p> On the first day, Binta stuck to time, dropped her game console when the alarm rung for studying, and
                read. The same happened on the second day and on the third. </p>

            <p> After four days, Binta started to snooze her alarm clocks to increase her gaming tome. She started to
                have little time to study, and soon, she went back to not studying at all. </p>

            <p> Binta’s story passes one message; Alarm clocks are not the solution to procrastination. They work for
                the moment but they do not solve it long term. You may now ask, ‘what then is the solution?’ </p>

            <p> I’ll tell you, but first, Have you ever done any activity without procrastinating? Have you ever asked
                yourself why you do not shift it to later and do it immediately? </p>

            <p> In Binta’s case, she never procrastinates gaming, why? It’s probably because she loves it and it arouses no form of anxiety for her. </p>

            <p> Which brings us to the solution to procrastination. The key to solving procrastination is knowing the root cause of it. Why can’t I do this immediately? What’s stopping me? </p>

            <p>When you’re able to answer those questions, then you begin your journey to understanding the reason for your procrastination and then solving it. </p>
            
            <p> And this is only an extract from the ebook I published two days ago called ‘The Key to Stopping Procrastination’ which already has sold 200 copies. It’s a 50-paged book that expands your mindset about how to tackle procrastination, why you should take it seriously, and how to deal with it long term. </p>
            
            <p> As a psychologist, I published this after several demands by people on my email list who constantly read my tips on personal excellence and wanted to have the bulk of it. I also thought it was a brilliant idea, so here it is, published with recommendations from two best Personal development psychologists. </p>

            <p> So, rest assured it’s the best book you could get to improve your life today. </p>

            <p> What’s more? For the first 20 people purchasing this ebook, you’ll get one of my other books free called, ‘Self-reflection’, and that for just $26 today. </p>
            
            <p> Unbelievable? I also think I’m doing a mini-Santa Clause parade, so you should take the opportunity before I decide to change my mind. </p>
            
            <p> Also, there’s an added bonus of gettig to know the end of Binta’s story (wink wink). So if you’ve decided you’ve spent enough time snoozing alarm clocks and carrying over tasks, and you want to become more productive, then click this link and get the key to the end of your procrastination (link). </p>
