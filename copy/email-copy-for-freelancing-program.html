            <h4> Subject line: The #1 step no Freelancer should miss </h4>

            <p> When I talk to a freelancer and ask them why they are freelancing, pretty much most of them tell me it’s for the money. </p>

            <p> I mean, who doesn’t like multiple streams of income, especially when it comes in the comfort of your home? </p>

            <p> There was a time I used to write without getting paid. I wrote out of goodwill, people begged me to write for them and I did. Just like that. Yes, now I think it was pretty dumb. </p>

            <p> But that was because I didn’t even know why I was freelancing and what I wanted from freelancing, which is the #1 of seven starter freelancing steps I want to tell you about. </p>

            <p> What’s the end goal of your freelance career? Are you doing it to supplement your income? Do you want to be a limited freelancer (part-time freelancer)? </p>

            <p> Just something you do on the weekends when pay is not good? Do you plan on expanding your career or you’re just looking for an escape from corporate jobs? </p>

            <p> Whatever it is, the first step is knowing. If you don’t agree with me, then surely you must agree with Arthur D. Hlavaty who said, ‘The first secret of getting what you want is knowing what you want’. </p>

            <p> I’m pretty certain most freelancers do not even sit to think of this. Most people just want to freelance because that’s what people are doing nowadays. </p>

            <p> But only when you know why you’re freelancing can you bring your reality to match your dream. Oh wow, how that sounded nice. </p>

            <p> So, before you go on your next freelance project, have a little conversation with yourself, you could write it down as well. </p>

            
            
            <p> ‘Why am I freelancing?’ ‘What’s the end goal of my freelance career?’ ‘What am I doing to match my reality to my goal?’ </p>



            <p> These are one of the things Walter and other top freelancers preach, just before you take any program. Your mindset has to be right. </p>

            <p> Walter has made over $30,000 as a freelancer. </p>

            <p> He has revealed all the strategies he and his students have used to consistently make $500-$1000 weekly doing the same thing you do painstakingly every day with no results. </p>

            <p> His students know the reason they went into freelancing in the first place and have worked towards aligning their reality with their dream. What they did was spend a few bucks to earn big. </p>

            <p> Just like, Samuel Kokumo </p>

            <p> He is one of the guys who enrolled for the HPF premium program under the zero – $2000 challenge. </p>

            <p> Before he joined he used to work a 9-5 that paid him just 70,000 naira per month </p>
            <p> Combined with all the stress of moving within Lagos traffic. </p>
            <p> He was fed up and was searching for how to increase his earnings. </p>
            <p> So he took the program and in less than 2 months he made over $1600. </p>
            <p> For context, $1600 at today’s exchange rate is N912,000. </p>

            <p> With his regular 9-5 job it would have taken him over 1 year to make this amount. But he did in just 2 months working from his phone in anyplace he desired. </p>
            <p> So, if you’re currently begging clients to pay you higher, having difficulty getting clients, you could change the narrative. </p>
            <p> You too can be making $500-$1000 every week. </p>
            <p> You just have to make up your mind and do whatever it takes to get that dream life you want. </p>
            <p> Okay, If this sounds like a good deal to you, click the link below to start learn how to start making up to $500-$1000 weekly as a freelancer. </p>
