            <h4> Subject line: Let your prospect take you out on a lunch date </h4>

            <p> It’s a new month, and the kindest gesture you could get from anyone right now is a lunch date. </p>

            <p> While that would be really nice, that sure is not what I’m talking about. Stick with me and I’ll tell you. </p>

            <p> Most entrepreneurs, copywriters miss one very important thing in their marketing. </p>

            <p> And that probably may be the reason they’re not converting enough or even worse, at all. </p>

            <p> And that one thing is market research. </p>

            <p> To sell anything to anyone you have to know who they are. Why? </p>

            <p> Oh common, because they are your prospects. And you want them to know that you understand them, what they want, how they feel and that most importantly, you can help them. </p>

            <p> So basically, be in synch with your customer’s inner most desires. Act like a detective in one of those crime fictions on netflix... that type of thing. </p>

            <p> Read what they read, watch the same television series, eat at their favorite restaurant, wear their clothes, eat their lunch... </p>

            <p> No, lol, you don’t have to those literally. </p>

            <p> What I mean is, research! Online and offline. </p>

            <p> And if you wished, you could take your prospect out on a lunch date. That would be great, lol, but certainly not necessary. </p>

            <p> Which reminds me, I’ll be having my monthly copywriting breakfast class at GoCity Mall in Lagos on the 6th of August. John Ferdinand, copywriting genius says, </p>

            <p> ‘Copywriting breakfast class has always come true to its promises. It has always been insightful, and is the perfect meal for every copywriter in today’s age. I won’t miss anyone.’ </p>



            <p> If you don’t believe what Ferdinand says, look what 100 other attendees, including Business mogul James Divine and Ola Samuel, are saying about last month’s breakfast class here. </p>

            <p> Not everyone believed it was a life-changer at first which is okay. Peace Moyo, one of my faithful attendees had called it ‘another scheme to defraud people of their money and time’. She was eventually convinced when she saw a snippet of the value given and how much people gained from it. </p>

            <p> I can’t tell you what to do, but I can certainly assure you this will help you and change your copywriting career. So click on this link (link) and register now. </p>
