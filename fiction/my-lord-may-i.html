            <h4 style="text-align: left;"> ORDER! </h4>

            <p> The Judge's gavel reminded me of Mama's sweaty palms gripping the old mortar, up and down and up and down, beating the guiltless yam. Her face was embellished with beads of sweat and a tinge of determination plastered on it. I used to perch around, taking delight in the aftermath of the beaten yam. The fluffy goodness that resulted from the battering. And oh, how sweet it was, with Mama's vegetable soup which did not but have various bells and whistles. A morsel was usually accompanied by ponmo (cow skin) and many fish. We used to eat it so delightedly. We used to lick our plates and ask for more, neglecting the protests of our protruding bellies. We used to dance round Mama's pot and ask for one more. I and Tanda, who was before this court today, were prosecuted for murder.</p>

            <p> 'You're advised to remain silent. This is a court room not your gossip centers!' the Judge barked at the members of the public who sat at the gallery. They all came to watch Tanda's trial, cry and laugh, and whisper hateful words about her to their friends, to be first-hand information town criers. They didn't come to hope that Tanda received any mercy. Tanda was a murderer, after all. </p>

            <p> 'My Lord, this woman deserves to be ejected from the society,' the lawyer who had left no stone unturned in lining out Tanda's deeds continued. 'She's a threat to the society, and in fact a disgrace to humanity. We've seen how with evidences and witnesses brought before this court has without doubt proven this fact. Tanda Omowa has against Section 315 of the Criminal code murdered Gani Bari…' nothing he said was new to me. He would go over the cruel thing that Tanda had done again and the witnesses he had brought. </p>


            <p> Gani Bari was Tanda's boyfriend. He was a cultist, and God knows I used everything I could to beg Tanda to stay away from him. Mama had also tried to the point where she got sick; Tanda had turned rogue no, and no one could stop her. Oh, Mama, Mama did teach us well; Mama used to sit us down and tell us tales. She used to teach us virtues, taking every moment to remind us to be good people. Beside me, every time did Tanda sit and listen just like I did, sucking all her fingers and listening with great intent as if chewing in every word that came out of Mama's mouth. </p>

            <p> What happened? I had no idea, but Tanda was now standing in the accused box, head fallen, waiting for the Judge to tell her how she was going to die. She had killed her boyfriend, who she used to say gave her lots of money and gifts. Tanda wanted all these, she always had. She took delight in luxurious things after she had met with those friends. The ones that paved their way into Tanda's heart and left a stench. Oh, cursed be the day they met; the day that had bred Tanda's greediness. </p>

            <p> Mama truly could not give everything, but Tanda could have endured like I did like I was still doing. She could not live the life I was living; she wanted more;- she let herself be driven to love money and luxurious things. I remember Tanda used to tell me to come with her and enjoy the life she lived. I didn't want it, not if I had to do the things Tanda did. </p>

            <p> 'I hereby sentence….' I adjusted in my seat as the Judge was about to tell us Tanda's fate. '…the accused, Tanda Omowa to death by hanging', I had expected it, but it didn't still help the hurt that slapped at my chest. I sat still on the cold seat while everyone lamented and hailed and jollied. I wanted not to feel anything, but I could not help it. Tanda knew it, too; she knew she was going to die. She glanced at me as she was carted away by policemen. And I saw it, the old Tanda, my innocent little sister; she looked at me with the hurt that stung her eyes, she looked at me with disappointment as if I had let her down, I had not fought for her. I had not considered that she may not have killed Gani Bari. I could not afford her a good lawyer. Everything came back, the memories.  </p>

            <p> My Tanda, my innocent Tanda, could not have killed someone. I wanted to tell the Judge this, to tell him; </p>

            <p> 'My Lord, Tanda could not have killed anyone. There must have been a mistake somewhere. She used to dance with me, my Tanda, with Mama as well. She used to sing and dance, she had a beautiful voice, one of an angel. Mama believed she could be a star one day. She used to cry home to me whenever she was beaten, and I'd go on to beat whoever had wronged her against Mama's will. I could kill someone but not Tanda. She was very sweet; she was only driven by the love for money, by her need for material things. She could not have killed a person.  </p>

            <p> My Lord, if I may, allow me to go home to bring sick Mama and everyone in our little community to tell of Tanda's beautiful heart. My Tanda was a loveable girl; she could not kill anyone.  There's had to be a mistake. Let them find whoever killed Gani Bari. Someone out there is roaming on the streets freely, the person who had killed Bari; find him. But let my Tanda go. She's innocent….' </p>

            <p> But it was too late to prove or say anything. Tanda was on her way to death, my sweet Tanda. </p>
