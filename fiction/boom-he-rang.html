            <h4> By Enifolarin Arinola </h4>

            <p> My blood ran cold as I heard his name. I could hear the thump of my heart almost too clearly. </p>

            <p> ‘What did you say?’ I shivered. </p>

            <p> ‘Your Dad, Mr. Thompson?’ Dave said as if confirming who he was to me. ‘He is at the door.’ I paused and observed Dave’s face for a moment. </p>

            <p> ‘Will you go and let him in or should I?’ He gestured to me. I didn’t say anything, reevaluating my decisions, shaken by how much evil this man sought to wrought. </p>

            <p> ‘Nevermind, I’ll just go.’ Dave said and stood up from the bed. </p>

            <p> ‘No!’ I jumped up, my head throbbing as I jerked it off the pillow. It was too early to do this, but there was no excuse to die. I met him just in time before he opened the door of our bedroom. </p>

            <p> ‘No, do not open that door, Dave.’ </p>


            <p> ‘What? That’s your Dad.’ What’s wrong with you?  </p>

            <p> ‘I heard that right.’ Dave has been my husband for four years; he had only met my Father once at our wedding and had no idea who he was, or more so, who I was. My family believed in a Faith that was completely different from others. We were all initiated by birth, so we had no choice. I couldn’t decide whether it was the right time to drop it on Dave. </p>

            <p> ‘Listen to me, the man at the door is not my Father, he is the leader of our Creed. You don’t want to open that door under any...’ I couldn’t end my statement before we heard louder bangs on the door. Dave leapt. </p>

            <p> ‘What’s happening, Sara? What are you talking about?’ He looked as perturbed as I wanted him to be. Great! I needed that fear so he’d listen to me. </p>

            <p> ‘We’re going to get a few clothes in a travel bag, get our passports and leave the country now.’ </p>

            <p> ‘What?’ </p>

            <p> ‘Yes Dave, we have to do it.’ We could hear him breaking through the glass window now. </p>

            <p> ‘We have to do it now, or he’s going to kill us!’ Dave sprung into action and ran towards the closet door, flinging it open. He scurried for a moment for a bag and later found a small one we used for picnics. He shuffled some clothes into the bag, not minding what they were. Meanwhile, I changed into a sweatpant and a tee-shirt, then I picked up our passports from the bedside drawer. </p>

            <p> What else?’ He said, panting. </p>

            <p> ‘We run!’ I barked. We ran towards the emergency exit, and for the first time, I was thankful we had no children. Thompson was going to stop at nothing to find us; it was a taboo to leave the Creed, ever. And I knew for a long time he was going to come after me, just like he had done my mother. We ran towards the door and yanked it open. I held him by the hand and made for the door. I didn’t have the time to check what it was. Then, at the door, we met a huge man holding tightly onto a big weapon. </p>

            <p> ‘Hello there, Sweet Sara’, my Father said. </p>
