            <h4> THREE PITFALLS OF FREELANCING PEOPLE RARELY TALK ABOUT </h4>

            <p> One of the hot topics in Nigeria today is digital money, particularly, freelancing. </p>

            <p> And most times, you'll hear people talk about how 9-5 jobs are out of fashion and how freelancing is amazing and is the absolute money making medium, so if you're not making money online, you're gradually riding your self down a steep hill to poverty. </p>

            <p> It is not untrue that freelancing is a big fish currently, and once you've caught it, you can make up to three times your average salary while on PJ sipping tea in your couch and hollering at your dog. </p>

            <p> But what people do not often talk about is the process of fishing. Of course, in this context, what I mean by 'Fishing' is 'Freelancing'. </p>

            <p> Well, of course, every business has its downside and the same goes with the freelance business, but the issue is, most people will have you think only about the glamorous part of freelancing; being your own boss, making your own schedules, relieving stress and what have you. Honestly, that can be really awesome, but it's not just enough that you know the good part without having an idea what you're up against. </p>

            <p> So, to avoid you falling for an all-too-common myth, I decided to nosedive into the topic and pull out some considerable significant data about freelancing that may helpful to you if you're ever considering Freelancing, or maybe, are at a rocky start. </p>

            <p> But before I tell you about it, I’ll give you a background idea of what freelancing is if you don’t already know. </p>

            <p> It simply is selling your skills or experiences to people, without committing to a single employer; but rather selling to a lot of employers. And if you have a skill like graphic design, writing, web design, marketing, video editing, photography, etc., you have a place in the Freelance world, and chances are you can make so much money from it. </p>

            <p> Sounds easy, right? </p>

            <p> However, before you get all excited, I'll let you know about 3 major pitfalls of freelancing you must also know and what you can do about them. So, here we go. </p>


            <p> <b>#Pitfall 1:</b> You need to work HARD as a freelancer. I know, that seems pretty obvious, but people often sweep this under the carpet. And this is because Freelance advocates will have you think Freelancing is like sitting in a park and watching random strangers drop money at your feet. </p>

            <p> Freelancing is not a get-money-quick scheme. To get the money, you have to do the work, especially if you're just starting. And this work evolves an endless cycle of finding clients, maintaining clients, and upskilling. In fact, in the beginning, you may not get clients for a long time even after putting so much time into it, and once you do get clients, you have to work on getting new ones. </p>

            <p> But hey, here's a tip: have an extremely marketable skill and be extremely good at it (I used extremely twice, wink wink). It is crucial as this gives you a competitive advantage over others and makes you confident of your self-worth. Also, determine how (your pricing value) and where you're going to sell your skill; Upwork? Fiverr? Your website? All? </p>

            <p> <b>#Pitfall 2:</b> You have to deal with WORKSPACE IRREGULARITIES. Being a freelancer entails having the knowledge that, sometimes, you will have no clients at all, and no work to do, and other times, there's just too much of workload. Either way, you have to be ready when the clients come. </p>

            <p> This may also means that your paycheck may not be coming in every single month. You know, like how your boss squeezes your salary into your hands every month, it's not like that here. Although, the gap between the paychecks may not be too long, but they do happen, and they happen frequently. </p>

            <p> So, to prepare yourself for this, have enough savings to get you through to the next gig. It's as commonsensical as that. And the fun thing is, once you've walked your self to the top as a freelancer, you just might start to appreciate the irregularities that come with Freelancing. </p>

            <p> <b>#Pitfall 3:</b> HOLIDAYS? For what? The last line of the previous paragraph is pretty much what I mean. As a freelancer, you're going to have to work when you don't want to, which means you may have to work odd hours, cancel plans with the girls, skip church service and sit in your room without seeing the sun for two days straight. That was a bit over the edge, lol, but the hustle is real. </p>

            <p> Yet, of course, there is a solution to that, and that is setting long delivery deadlines to give you time to prepare for the unexpected, tell your clients you won't be taking jobs, switch off your phone and go on a vacay, then, thank me later. </p>

            <p> So yeah, Freelancing is really awesome, but you must know what it is you are getting into before you get into it. Freelancing requires 3 P's; Perseverance, Patience and Progress. At the end of the day, you'll discover your hard work is totally worth it when the paycheck starts rolling in. And trust me, I'll definitely pick freelancing over crossing bridges and seas to get to a 9-5 job everyday and getting little for the trouble. </p>

            <p> What's your pick? </p>

            <p> P.S: If you enjoyed this article, then it may interest you to know that Freelancers are now taking a Freelancing program by Walter Enyinnaya that teaches you major freelancing skills and everything you need to know about getting clients.
